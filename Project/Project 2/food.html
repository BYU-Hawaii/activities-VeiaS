        <p>Rarotonga's unique cuisine is a delightful fusion of Polynesian and European influences, showcasing the island's abundant fresh produce and seafood. From traditional dishes to modern interpretations, the flavors of Rarotonga will captivate your heart.</p>
        <p>One of the island's most iconic and unique dishes is Ika Mata, a raw fish dish cured in citrus juices and coconut cream. The name ika means fish, and mata refers to raw, literally translating to raw fish. However, because of the way the dish is prepared, the dish is not entirely raw. Using the ancient cooking technique of citrus, the fish is partially cooked in the marinade overnight. This refreshing and flavorful delicacy is a staple in Rarotonga and a must-try for seafood lovers.</p>

        <p>After colonization, the Cook Islands adopted many Western practices, including food. Doughnuts are one of the many favorite foods in the Cook Islands. Local bakeries will make fresh batches of plain doughnuts in the mornings, and by 7am, they will be sold out. Many people choose this as their breakfast paired with a hot cup of tea or a cup of milo, and this is the perfect way to start your day. Chocolate doughnuts, plain doughnuts, and cream doughnuts are sold throughout Rarotonga. My favorite is the cream doughnuts; I have not had anything like it anywhere else in the world.</p>

        <p>Rarotonga is also known for its poke dishes. These consist of boiled and mashed bananas baked and served with sweetened coconut cream. The banana poke has a pudding texture that makes the dish unique. The flavors of banana and coconut blend together so well that it creates a craving for more. This is on the sweeter side of the food made by cook islanders and is usually eaten together on the same plate as your salads and meats. Poke is not for everyone, but you must try it when visiting Rarotonga. This cannot be bought in restaurants but is available at the Punanga Nui Market every Saturday.</p>
