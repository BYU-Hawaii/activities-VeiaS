        <p>Watch for the Cook Islands' national bird, the Kakerori, during the Cross Island hike. The Kakerori is the Rarotongan Monarch and is critically endangered. It is rare to see one of these birds, but if you do see one, you are sure to experience good luck.</p>
        <h3>Some essential facts about the Kakerori:</h3>
