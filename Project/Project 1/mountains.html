    <p>For those seeking an unforgettable hiking experience, the Cross Island Trek is a must-do. This challenging yet rewarding trail takes you through dense rainforests, past cascading waterfalls, and to the highest point of the island, offering panoramic views that will leave you in awe. The best part is that becuse there are no dangerous animals living on the island you can hike early in the morning or late in the evening and still be safe.</p>

    <p>Along the Cross Island hike be sure to keep an eye out for the Cook Islands national bird the Kakerori. The Kakerori is the Rarotongan Monarch and is critically endangered. It is rare to see one of these birds but if you do see one you are sure to experience good luck.</p>
    <p>Some important facts about the Kakerori:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Kakerori (Pomarea dimidiata) is a small olive-brown flycatcher that is only found naturally on Rarotonga.</li>
      <li>The Kakerori is one of the rarest birds in the world, with only an estimated 150-300 individuals remaining in the wild as of 2022. Its population has declined dramatically due to habitat loss and predation by invasive rat species.</li>
      <li>The Kakerori is considered a treasure to Cook Islanders because it is an important part of their natural heritage. (You will see the Kakerori featured on some of the Cook Islands rare bank notes)</li>
      <li>Seeing or hearing the distinctive rattle call of the Kakerori is a one in a lifetime oppotunity.</li>
    </ul>
