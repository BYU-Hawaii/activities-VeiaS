      Avarua is the lively heart of Rarotonga. In the morning, the town streets wake up with busy outdoor markets. The air is filled with good smells of fresh fish, ripe fruits, and sweet flower garlands made by local crafters.

      As you walk through the colorful market stalls, you'll see lots of neat handmade goods. There are woven baskets, bright sarongs, and prized black pearls Rarotonga is known for. Each stall shows the rich culture of the Cook Islands. When night falls, Avarua becomes a fun place to go out. Bars and restaurants are full of people enjoying traditional island music and laughter.
      
      But Avarua is more than just shopping and eating - it's a place for adventure too! You can explore the sunken Wreck of the Maitai ship which is now an exciting dive spot. Just outside of town are ancient trails like the Ara Metua road where you can hike and see Rarotonga's wild beauty and old stories. Whether you want an exciting town visit or an outdoor adventure, Avarua has lots of fun things to experience.

    <p>Explore the sunken wreck of Maitai situated across Trader Jacks. The Maitai wreck is the perfect spot to dive and explore the misteries of the ocean. Years ago a ship traveled to the isalnd of Rarotonga but upon arrival got stuck on the reef. Nothing could be done so the crew came on island and through the years and the many storms the only thing left of the ship is the engine boiler stuck on the reef marking the beginning of the deep blue ocean.</p>
