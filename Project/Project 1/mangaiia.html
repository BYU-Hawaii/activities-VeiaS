    <p>Kia orana! I'm Tavai, and while I grew up on Rarotonga, I have a deep appreciation for the ancient and mysterious island of Mangaia. Known as the "Ancient Heart of Polynesia," Mangaia is the oldest and most culturally significant island in the Cook Islands.</p>

    <p>One of Mangaia's most fascinating features is the Makatea, a series of raised coral cliffs that encircle the island's interior. These cliffs, formed millions of years ago, are home to ancient cave systems and rock shelters that were once inhabited by our ancestors. Exploring the Makatea and its archaeological sites is a truly remarkable experience.</p>

    <p>Mangaia is also renowned for its rich cultural traditions and craftsmanship. The island is home to skilled weavers, woodcarvers, and tattoo artists who continue to practice their art using traditional methods passed down through generations. Be sure to visit the Mangaia Arts and Crafts Village to witness these ancient traditions firsthand.</p>
