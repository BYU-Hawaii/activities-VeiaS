    <p>One of the island's most popular beaches is Muri Beach, a picturesque lagoon framed by lush palm trees and surrounded by a vibrant coral reef. This beach offers excellent snorkeling opportunities, where you can explore the underwater world teeming with colorful marine life. Off the shore of Muri beach is where you will find 4 smaller islands we call 'motu's' these motu's are unique as they home some of the rarer sealife, in addition the most popular of the four hosts a private show lead by Koka lagoon cruise. The show consists of traditional demonstrations (dancing, husking coconuts, tieing local attaire and climbing coconut trees). At the conclusion of the show guests gather for an 'umu kai' with the best chicken, pork, fish and other local delacacies.</p>

    <p>While Muri is definately a tourist attraction not all beaches are busy and crowded as this beach is. For those seeking a more secluded experience, the beaches of Titikaveka and Aroa offer a tranquil escape. These are the beaches that locals will normally go to when they have the time and you can be guarenteed to find you are the only person on that beach or one of a few. These hidden gems are perfect for relaxing, sunbathing, and taking in the stunning natural beauty of Rarotonga.</p>
