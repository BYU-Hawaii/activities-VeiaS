      <p>Rarotonga is renowned for its breathtaking beaches, where the turquoise waters of the South Pacific meet pristine white sands and swaying palm trees. These shores are a true paradise for beach lovers and water enthusiasts alike. People can catch amazing sunsets and sunrises from all sides of the island at any beach. Rarotonga is surrounded by coral reefs protecting the lagoon from large, powerful waves, creating an experience where you feel like swimming in a large warm bath that allows total and complete relaxation.</p>

      <p>One of the island's most popular beaches is Muri Beach, a picturesque lagoon framed by lush palm trees and a vibrant coral reef. This beach offers excellent snorkeling opportunities to explore the underwater world, teeming with colorful marine life. Off the shore of Muri Beach, you will find 4 smaller islands we call 'moto's.' These motu are unique as they are home to some rarer sealife. In addition, the most popular of the four hosts a private show led by the Koka Lagoon cruise. The show consists of traditional demonstrations (dancing, husking coconuts, tying local attire, and climbing coconut trees). After the show, guests gather for an 'umu kai' with the best chicken, pork, fish, and other local delicacies.</p>

      <p>While Muri is a tourist attraction, not all beaches are as busy and crowded as this one. For those seeking a more secluded experience, the beaches of Titikaveka and Aroa offer a tranquil escape. These are the beaches that locals will typically go to when they have the time, and you can be guaranteed to find you are the only person on that beach or one of a few. These hidden gems are perfect for relaxing, sunbathing, and taking in the stunning natural beauty of Rarotonga.</p>
