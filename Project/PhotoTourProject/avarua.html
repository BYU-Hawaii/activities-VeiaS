      <p>Avarua is the lively heart of Rarotonga. In the morning, the town streets wake up with busy outdoor markets. The air is filled with good smells of fresh fish, ripe fruits, and sweet ei's (flower garlands) made by locals. Walking through the colorful market stalls, you'll see many beautiful handmade goods, including woven baskets, bright sarongs, and Cook Island black pearls. Each stall shows the rich culture of the Cook Islands. When night falls, Avarua is a fun place to go out. Bars and restaurants are full of people enjoying traditional island music and laughter. But Avarua is more than just shopping and eating - it's a place for adventure, too! You can explore the sunken Wreck of the Maitai ship, which is now an exciting dive spot. Just outside town are ancient trails like the Ara Metua road, where you can hike and see Rarotonga's wild beauty and old stories. Whether you want an exciting town visit or an outdoor adventure, Avarua has many fun things to experience.</p>
      <p>Explore the sunken Wreck of Maitai situated across Trader Jack. The Maitai wreck is the perfect spot to dive and explore the ocean's mysteries. Years ago, a ship traveled to the island of Rarotonga but, upon arrival, got stuck on the reef. Nothing could be done, so the crew came onto the island. Through the years and the many storms, the only thing left of the ship was the engine boiler stuck on the reef, marking the beginning of the deep blue ocean.</p>

      <p>Towards the west side of Avarua, you will find the colorful, vibrant, and lively Punanga Nui Market. Saturday morning to afternoon and when you will experience the most from the market. With most people off work on the weekends and every Cook Islander with their own small business owner, you can find foods, crafts, and shows here. One thing you must take advantage of is the waffle shack that sells the best crunchy waffles on the island. This breakfast meal will surely make you crave more after the first bite. Other must-have products from the market are local crafts, hats, earrings, bags, clothes, pareaus, etc. Take advantage of the opportunity to visit the iconic Punanga Nui Cultural Market, where you can immerse yourself in the local arts, music, and dance.</p>

      <p>Avarua closes every day at 4:30-5pm, and once the sun sets, the nightlife begins. Avarua is the central hub for night activities, where you will find more than half of the nightclubs on the island. This area is filled with Reggae music from sunset to 2am, Monday to Friday. The Rehab nightclub also provides a party bus. This open-standing bus drives you around the island, blasting music and allowing you and your friends to dance on the go.</p>
      <p>For those who find that nightclub life is not for them, Avarua also has a string of Christmas lights that stretch throughout the whole village of Rarotonga on the main road, giving a magical feeling. Driving through Avarua at night is peaceful as you are the only person on the road while everyone else is at home or out at the club.</p>
