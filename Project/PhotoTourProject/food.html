      <p>One of the island's most iconic and unique dishes is Ika Mata, a raw fish dish cured in citrus juices and coconut cream. The name ika means fish and mata refers to raw literally translating to raw fish. However because of the way the dish is prepared the dish is not completely raw. Using the ancient cooking technique of citris the fish is partially cooked in the marinade overnight. This refreshing and flavorful delicacy is a staple in Rarotonga and a must-try for seafood lovers.</p>

      <p>After colonization the Cook Islands adopted many western practices including food. Doughnuts are one of the many favourite foods in the Cook Islands. Local bakeries will make fresh batches of plain doughnuts in the mornings and by 7am will be sold out. Many people choose this as their breakfast paired with a hot cup of tea or cup of milo this is the perfect way to start off your day. You will find chocolate doughnuts, plain doughnuts, and crem doughnuts sold all throughout the island of rarotonga. My personal favourite is the cream doughnuts, I have not had anything like it anywhere else in the world. </p>

      <p>Rarotonga is also known for their poke dishes. These consist of boiled and mashed bananas baked and served with sweetened coconut cream. The banana poke has a pudding texture to it that makes the dish unique. The flavors of banana and coconut blend together so well that it creates a craving for more. This is on the sweeter side of the food make by cook islanders and is normally eaten together on the same plate as your salads and meats. Poke is not for everyon but it is something that you need to try when visiting Rarotonga. This cannot be bought in restaurants but is available at the Punanga Nui Market every Saturday.</p>
