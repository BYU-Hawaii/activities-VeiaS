            <p>This Vietnamese sandwich recipe is an authentic grilled chicken banh mi packed with exciting flavors, colors and textures. And it’s SO easy to make!</p>
            <P>One thing I love about this Vietnamese sandwich recipe, is the versatility of the sauce. You can use the sauce as a marinade before grilling the chicken. But you can also toss already grilled strips of chicken with the sauce! It’s a great way to use leftover chicken, or to save time with store bought chicken. Sometimes I will buy the pack of Costco grilled chicken breast strips, and just toss the banh mi sauce in one of the bags so I can make sandwiches throughout the week. The quick pickle is super easy to make, and can be used immediately, or kept in the fridge for using whenever you’re craving a Vietnamese sandwich.</P>

            <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
            <h4>GRILLED CHICKEN</h4>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Mix the marinade ingredients in a zip top bag.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken breasts to the bag and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Longer is better!</li>
                <li>>Put the hot tap water and sugar in a jar. Close the jar and shake until the sugar dissolves. </li>
                <li>Add the vinegar, salt, red pepper, sliced carrots and radishes. Close the jar and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
                <li>Heat the grill to medium. Grill the chicken breasts for 5-10 minutes per side, until thermometer reads 160F internal temperature. Remove from heat and cover them with foil to rest for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Open the sub rolls and grill the insides for about 1-3 minute—until toasted. You can also toast them in the oven if you are making this with already cooked meat.</li>
                <li>Drain the pickled veggies. Slice the chicken into thin pieces.</li>
                <li>Spread the inside of the sub rolls with mayonnaise. Layer the cucumbers, chicken, pickled veggies, mint and jalapeños (if you're using them) in the rolls.</li>

            <h2>NOTES</h2>
            <p>If you would like to make this recipe with chicken that is already cooked, it's easy to adapt. Just cut the amount of marinade ingredients in half. The toss the cooked, sliced chicken in a bag with the marinade.</p>
            <p>For the carrot and radish pickle, the easiest way to get julienne strips is by using a julienne peeler. Here's our favorite julienne peeler.</p>
