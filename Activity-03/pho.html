            <h2>What is Pho?</h2>
            <p>
                If you’re wondering “What is Pho?” then you’re probably also wondering “Why is she so bonkers over it???” 
                I don’t blame you. It looks like a relatively harmless bowl of beef noodle soup.
                That is, until you take your first slurp.
                The Pho soup broth is everything. It’s light yet full of flavour, deceptively beefy, savoury, complex, has the tiniest hint of richness and is filled with beautiful spices like cinnamon.
                It is, without question, one of The Best Soups in the whole world!
            </p>
            <cite>Pho is the first thing you seek upon landing in Vietnam, always choosing vendors crowded with locals rather than tourists!</cite>

            <h2>How to make Beef Pho</h2>
            <p>While you’ll need to man handle a considerable mound of bones and beef, I think you might be surprised how straightforward it actually is to make pho. It’s more time than anything – and a very big pot!</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Quick boil – Remove impurities from beef with a 5 minute boil, it’s the path to a beautiful clear soup;</li>
                <li>Scum – be amazed at all the icky stuff that comes out;</li>
                <li>Wash the bones to get all the icky scum off;</li>
                <li>Simmer for 3 hours – bones, beef, water, onion, ginger and spices (cinnamon, cardamom, coriander, star anise);</li>
                <li>Remove brisket  – some is used for Pho topping, see below recipe for ways to use remainder;</li>
                <li>Simmer 40 minutes further with just bones;</li>
                <li>Strain; then</li>
                <li>Ladle into bowls over noodles and pile on Toppings!</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Heat a heavy based skillet over high heat (no oil) until smoking.</li>
                <li>Place onion and ginger in pan cut side down. Cook for a few minutes until it's charred, then turn. Remove and set aside.</li>
                <li>Toast Spices lightly in a dry skillet over medium high heat for 3 minutes. </li>
            </ol>

            <p>REMOVE IMPURITIES:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Rinse bones & brisket then cover with water in large stock pot.</li>
                <li>Boil for 5 minutes, then drain.</li>
                <li>Rinse each bone and brisket under tap water.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>BROTH:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Wipe pot clean, bring 3.5 litres / 3.75 quarts water to boil.</li>
                <li>Add bones and brisket, onion, ginger, Spices</li>
                <li>Add onion, ginger, Spices, sugar and salt - water should just barely cover everything.</li>
                <li>Cover with lid, simmer 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Remove brisket (should be fall-apart tender), cool then refrigerate for later.</li>
                <li>Simmer remaining soup UNCOVERED for 40 minutes.</li>
                <li>Strain broth into another pot, discard bones and spices. Should be about 2.5 litres / 2.65 quarts (10 cups), if loads more, reduce.</li>
                <li>Add fish sauce, adjust salt and sugar if needed. Broth should be beefy, fragrant with spices, savoury and barely sweet.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>ASSEMBLE:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Prepare rice noodles per packet, just prior to serving.</li>
                <li>Place noodles in bowl. Top with raw beef and brisket.</li>
                <li>Ladle over about 400 / 14 oz hot broth - will cook beef to medium rare.</li>
                <li>Serve with Toppings on the side!</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Recipe Notes</p>
            <p> Optional (the other Toppings are essential, at least 1 herb)</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>Bones & brisket for broth </strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Brisket - don't skip this, adds way more flavour into broth than any bones and other beef cuts like chuck (brisket has intense beef flavour). If omitted, broth is weak. Leftovers not wasted - see in post for easy, really terrific ways to use up. Also FREEZES for months.</li>
                        <li>Brisket sub - boneless beef short ribs</li>
                        <li>Leftover cooked beef - see below recipe card for uses, also this Vietnamese Shredded Beef I shared specifically to use the leftover cooked beef!</li>
                        <li>Marrow bones add richness to the broth but not as much flavour. Use leg bones, knuckle, anything that is cut in a way so you can SEE some of the marrow (so it can leach out).</li>
                        <li>Marrow bones can be subbed with more meaty beef bones but soup may lack richness</li>
                        <li>Australia - meaty bones used are called "soup bones" at supermarkets. Brisket and marrow bones from butcher.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong> Fish Sauce -</strong>can sub with light soy but flavour will be a tiny bit different. Still VERY tasty</li>
                <li><strong> Noodles -</strong>any flat rice noodles fine here. Use medium size - not super thin like vermicelli or really wide like Pad See Ew</li>
                <li><strong>Finely sliced beef -</strong>Partially freeze (about 30 minutes), then slice as thinly as possible. Could also buy thinly sliced frozen beef from Asian butchers.<br> Other tender beef also ok. PS If raw beef is off putting for you, just dunk in soup broth before adding into bowls.</li>
                <li><strong>Serving -</strong>Traditionally, the soup is served with just noodles, broth and beef with all the Toppings listed above on the side. The idea is to help yourself to Toppings as you eat the Pho.</li>
