                <p>
                    <p>My name is Veia-Atua (Lowry) Sun, a senior at <abbr title="Brigham Young University-Hawaii">BYU-Hawaii</abbr>, studying psychology in hopes to understand human behavior and the drivers of motivation. Coming from the island of Rarotonga, I've spent years wondering why people behave the way they do and if there is an explanation for this. I have come to undeatand the quote from Dr. Seuss <cite> "Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple."</cite></p>
                    <p>A little over a year ago I was sealed to my husband HengLong Sun from Cambodia. I am the seventh of ten children while he is an only child. I admire his resilience and determination in accomplishing his goals. Like our culture and family life our interests also differ; He is a senior pursuing a degree in Computer Science interested in solving problems and advancing technology while my interests are more philosophical.</p>
                    <p>I love both indoor seclusion and outdoor exploration. Some days, I'm content to remain cocooned within my home, engaging in thought-provoking literature or losing myself in the world of creative imagination. But on other days my boredom drives me to get out of my head and explore the world, seeking thrills and finding joy in connecting to my soul and body through the environment.</p>
                    <p>Since graduating high school in 2017, I have asked myself the question <em> Who are you and who do you want to be?</em> I constantly challenge the assumptions I hold about who I think I am as I come to know me better. The biggest adventure I think I will ever explore in life is the journey of personal self-discovery.
